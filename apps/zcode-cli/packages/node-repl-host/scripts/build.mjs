// Officially packaged Computer Use has been completely
// Not available - each CUA call either waits until the MCP client times out (measured 60/110/120s), or waits ~64s before returning
// "permission broker socket is not accepting connections yet".
//
// Link: Lazy startup (`lazy startup` comment in services/src/node.ts) put darwin on Helper
// The installation/pull is moved from the host to "SDK pulls itself when calling CUA for the first time", and that path runs in **this package**——
// `helperInstaller` therefore enters the official package with this bundle. But `__ZCODE_CUA_HELPER_BUILD_ID__` was previously
// **Only** packages/desktop/tsup.config.ts injection (Electron main/app.asar), this file
// esbuild doesn't call a single define. So `ZCODE_CUA_HELPER_BUILD_ID` of producer in the official package
// Fold into an empty string (see the bottom line of zcode-cua/src/broker/shared/cua-version.ts),
// `resolveExpectedCuaHelperBuildId()` returns null and the helperInstaller hits the fail-closed guard:
//
//   "Packaged ZCode is missing its embedded Computer Use Helper build identity;
//    refusing an unpinned Helper install"
//
// As a result, the Helper neither installed nor started, and did not write a single line of logs. The throw statement was translated into a timeout by the MCP layer, and there was no inventory point——
// So it remains invisible. Empirical evidence: `[cua-product-helper]` in the host log is on 09-11 (host path, with define)
// There are 5 lines, 09-14 is 0 lines; `~/.zcode/computer-use/logs/` has never been created; after renaming the installed Helper
// Nor will it be reinstalled. dev is not affected (ALLOW_UNSIGNED_LOCAL + non-production runtime bypasses this guard),
// Therefore, it is only exposed in the official package and cannot be tested locally.
//
// The value remains the same source as the desktop side: CI injects ZCODE_CUA_HELPER_BUILD_ID env; dev is an empty string to avoid
// (dev Helper does not perform download/pin verification). See the comments for the define of the same name in packages/desktop/tsup.config.ts.
