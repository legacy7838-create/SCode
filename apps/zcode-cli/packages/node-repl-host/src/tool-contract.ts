// This number has been retained: it has always been the version announced by the node_repl server. Changing the number is equivalent to changing the protocol needlessly.
// From then on it changes with the host contract (bridge members, tool surface) and is decoupled from the respective versions of the two plugins.
// Upgraded to 0.5.0: The host contract itself has changed this time (node_repl was extracted from browser-use into an independent seed unit,
// The tool surface is adjusted according to the reconstruction and adjustment of CUA's node_repl SDK), and it should be moved according to the above rule. Numbers are the same as browser-use 0.5.0
// It's just a coincidence of homologous history and does not constitute coupling - the two are still upgraded independently.
// Upgraded to 0.6.0: The tool surface has converged to only `js`, `js_reset` and `js_add_node_module_dir` together
// moduleDirs capability is removed together. The former has been a fixed return successful no-op since the fresh-kernel transformation, and "never fails"
// The model will be called repeatedly (repeated calls will continue to consume the budget); the latter
// It pushes the hosting responsibility to the model - the model cannot know which node_modules to pass on its own, all it can tell is the skill document.
// The path that the document knows can be injected by the host itself. The measured call volume of both is 0. If the host protocol changes, serverInfo must be
// Identify based on this, otherwise the host cannot distinguish which generation of tool surface it is connected to.
