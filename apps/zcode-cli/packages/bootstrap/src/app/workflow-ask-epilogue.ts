// Separate file: workflow-driver.ts has already exceeded max-lines, and this section is pure copy + a schema detection.
// Has nothing to do with the driver's state machine.
//
// The endnote was branched by persona's tool level - the zero-tool GLM subagent read "every finding
// cites what you read or ran" and then find a tool it doesn't have and issue `escalate("placeholder")`.
// The entire tool stall is withdrawn, and each sub-agent
// All have a complete working toolset, endnotes back to a text.

/**
 * The quality epilogue for every ask: the content standard for a result — evidence,
 * the distinction between "ran it" and "believes it", stating honestly the parts that could not be done, escalating when blocked. Added for both typed and untyped asks; for typed
 * ones the schema epilogue follows immediately after. When the schema's top-level properties contain `evidence` / `confidence`, those two fields are called out by name;
 * if they are absent, they are not mentioned at all.
 * Format (this comment is the contract): two blank lines + a separator line + a title line + a bullet list.
