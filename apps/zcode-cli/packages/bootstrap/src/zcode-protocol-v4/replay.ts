// Playback export bucket.
//
// The downstream playback page uses the CLI's own three-stage reducer in the browser to reconstruct the persistent MessageWithParts into
// ConversationSnapshot: synthesizeEventsFromMessages → mergeColdConversationEvents →
// ProductProjection(hydration replay). All three are pure functions/pure classes, without node dependencies - this discipline is governed by
// `vite build` mechanical check of the browser playback package (once the node built-in module import is mixed into the bucket, the browser package will immediately fail to build).
//
// Just re-export, don't define anything.
