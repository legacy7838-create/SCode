// @zcode/core eagerly imported CJS from tool/handlers/write.js -> memory/origin-session.js
// yaml, yaml internal require("process") happens to hit shim, causing dist/mcp/server.js to be in the **module evaluation phase**

// The performance is mcp.server.closed / mcp.server.failed, 0 tools are registered, and mcp__node_repl__js is completely invisible on the model side.
// Inject the real createRequire here and let the shim fall on the available require (the product is still ESM).
// Add to both bundles: browser-client currently does not have CJS dependencies, but it is also an ESM product and will be dragged into one later.
// CJS dependencies will blow up at load time in the same way.
