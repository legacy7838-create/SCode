// ============================================================
// GetWorkflowRun Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// Adaptation details of a single workflow run: running → progress summary + log tail; final state → product / failure.
//
// The handler only does four things that the port cannot do:
//   1. **Product serialization**. What the port hands over is the **original value** of the script return value; the model-oriented text projection has a unique value in core
//      Implements (`serializeWorkflowArtifact`, completion notifications share it with TaskOutput). Do it again on the port side
//      It will appear that "the product of the same run looks different in the notification and in this tool."
//   2. **Normalization of unknown runId**. The port returns `undefined`, the model expects a structured failure.
//   3. **Read the clock once**. `generatedAt` is taken once here, and all "how long ago" in the model are calculated for it——
//      The formatter is therefore a pure function, and two ages in an output are always comparable.
//   4. **Spell abstract**. `summary` is spelled out deterministically from structured fields (get-workflow-run-summary.ts),
//      No models are involved.
//
// Deliberately **not doing** wait/block semantics: waiting is TaskOutput's job, here is an instant snapshot.

  "- A stopped run (other than a superseded one) can be continued with ResumeWorkflowRun — no rebuild needed, same run ID, same script.",
  "- ANY run — completed, stopped, errored, or still running — can instead be revised with AmendWorkflow: pass its run ID and the corrected script, and the finished work is imported as cache.
