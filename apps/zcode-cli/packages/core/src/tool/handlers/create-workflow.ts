// ============================================================
// CreateWorkflow Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// Typechecks a dynamic-workflow script against the facade, and — once the user has
// confirmed at the gate — starts the run in the background through
// `DynamicWorkflowRunPort`.
//
// Two paths, determined by whether the port is injected:
//   1. Port present (production wiring): clean compile + Allow → port.submit → output
//      {status: "backgrounded", backgroundTaskId: runId}, the result is returned to the main agent through the background notification pipeline.
//   2. Port absence (unwired host, single test): Keep the occupancy behavior before wiring - only return the diagnosis and cause-and-effect diagram, and execute nothing.
//
// The bad script path has nothing to do with the port and is completely unchanged: `prepareApproval` cuts off the pop-up window, and the handler returns directly to diagnosis.
// Do not start or build a run (asking the user to approve a piece of code that cannot be compiled will only interrupt the agent's own decision-making with an ineffective decision.
// Correct the error and retry the circuit).
