// ============================================================
// ListWorkflowRuns Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// Enumerate workflow runs by project (= session's working directory), with cross-session history.
//
// The handler is deliberately **very thin**: labels, attribution annotations, state synthesis, and timestamps are all cooked and handed over by the run service.
// (The port's `DynamicWorkflowRunListItem` annotation explains why the raw material is out of bounds). There are only three things to do here:
// Get the port, pin the cwd to the session's working directory, and project the result into a contract shape.
