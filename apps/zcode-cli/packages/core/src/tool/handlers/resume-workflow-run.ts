// ============================================================
// ResumeWorkflowRun Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// Resume a stopped dwf run (model-side entry; recoverable set = `stopped`, regardless of reason). See port contract
// `DynamicWorkflowRunPort.resume` (contracts/src/interfaces/dynamic-workflow-run.port.ts).
//
// The handler is deliberately **very thin**: gate (recoverable set determination), registry replacement, compileOnce/scriptHash revalidation are all in
// The port.resume server only does three things here: getting the port, transparently transmitting the run_id, and projecting the result into a contract shape.
// The output backgrounded shape allows the executor to follow the same automatic trace of CreateWorkflow
// (call-runner → trackBackgroundTask), snapshot/wait/cancel/notify zero new code.
//
// resume is scriptHash
// Nailed on the same script that was approved when submitting, in the same risk profile as the UI Resume button, the model call is executed directly;
// PreToolUse deny and project deny rules can still block. There is no prepareApproval: there is no synchronization means to verify the runId.
// After the bad id is approved, run_not_found will still fail and nothing will be deleted from the pop-up window.
