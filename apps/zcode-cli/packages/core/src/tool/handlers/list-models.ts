// List the configured models of this host.

// There is only one reason for existence: the main agent needs to select a subagent model (`subagent_model`) for a workflow run. It is not a model selection
// Switch ** - This tool cannot change the session's own model. This sentence must be clearly stated in the description, otherwise the model will treat it as
// "Switch myself" entry, and then report to the user that a switch has not occurred.
//
// There are two complementary paths to the parser (model-reference.ts): the one is passive (when the user says a name and cannot figure it out)
// Returned together with candidates), this one is proactive ("What models do we have available?"). Both reads are from the same **live** directory.
// ——Every time the port calls the current read registry view, it will never return the frozen copy during the construction period.
