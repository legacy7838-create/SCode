// The workflow actor (sub-AgentRuntime) uses it to upgrade a **true blocking** to the main agent that created this workflow and park it
// Wait for the answer in your ask. The handler hands the problem to the injected WorkflowEscalatePort and blocks waiting for the outcome:
//   - answered → Returns the answer text given by the main agent; the actor's turn continues on the spot, and the ask settles as usual.
//   - refused → Return to the copy written by the port (the budget has been exhausted/nothing to ask).
//
// Both are **normal tool results**, not ToolHandlerFailure. This is separate from submit_result's reject:
// The error tool_result there is the "repair channel" (the model should be retried), and there is nothing to fix here - put
// The "upgrade budget has been exhausted" rendering error will only cause the model to hit the same wall repeatedly, and opportunistic bypassing is exactly the behavior this feature aims to eliminate.
//
// If the port is absent, a ConfigurationError will still be thrown (according to submit_result): This tool only injects the port into the actor session.
// Registration, getting here is a wiring failure, not an ending.
