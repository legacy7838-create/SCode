// CreateWorkflow display graph bounding - Bounded projection of tool output boundaries
// ============================================================
// Unpacked from create-workflow.ts: stage glossary lets
// The handler file exceeds the max-lines upper limit, and the clipping itself is a piece of self-consistent pure logic - the analyzer enters the entire graph, and the contract
// Out of shape, no I/O, no memo, no ports. with zcode-protocol-v4/create-workflow-display.ts from
// rows.ts breaks out the same precedent.
//
// What is installed here is a **display diagram** rather than a mirror image of the cause and effect diagram. The second layer is subagent-oriented: only the site table is left in the step layer.
// (Running state and viewer keys, no longer drawn, no longer with edges), the participant layer (subagent card + handover edge at each stage) is composed of
// The handover graph projection of the analyzer is provided. Here we only do upper limit and forwarding. The stage layer is still the stage quotient of the control flow graph and is still reduced by this layer.
// (Folding and point reduction are in create-workflow-graph-fold.ts). The edge has only one shape: `{from, to, back?}`;
// Region / certainty / edge types stay in the analyzer, the GUI never reads them. Function name and payload field name inheritance history.
