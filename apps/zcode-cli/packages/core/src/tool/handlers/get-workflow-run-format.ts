// This is a **pure function** `(output) => text`: all clock readings have been put into `generatedAt` by the handler,
// The formatter itself does not touch `Date.now()`. One output therefore only has one ruler - two "how long ago" in the same output
// Always comparable, the test can nail the entire text verbatim.
//
// The block sequence is a contract (fixed sequence): first explain the situation in one sentence, then the identity and life cycle, and then
// **What is waiting for the model to do at the moment** (the problem of parking), and then how is the run, narrative, ending and routing.
