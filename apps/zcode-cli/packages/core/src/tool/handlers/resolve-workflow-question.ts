// ============================================================
// ResolveWorkflowQuestion Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// It is used by the master agent to answer blocking questions when an actor escalates from a running workflow. See port `DynamicWorkflowRunPort.resolveQuestion`.
//
// The handler is deliberately **very thin**: qid table lookup, driver settlement, and event dual-tracking are all on the port server. Only three things are done here:
// Get the port (typeof detection, follow the resume/listRuns precedent), transparently transmit the qid and answer, and project the result into the contract shape.
//
// Reject copywriting ** transparent transmission ** server-side message: that text is written by the layer that writes the registration form (stating the current situation and next step),
// If the discriminating key and copy are maintained separately, the two places will say different things sooner or later, and the reader here is the model - what it reads is its next step.
// Therefore, the three rejection branches of this file are only responsible for selecting a stable errorCode and do not rewrite a word.
