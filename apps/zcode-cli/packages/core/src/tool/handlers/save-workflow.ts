// ============================================================
// SaveWorkflow Tool Handler
// ============================================================
// Save a dwf script along with metadata as a reusable definition in the project.
//
// The shape is intentionally isomorphic to CreateWorkflow because to the model these are two verbs for the same thing:
//   1. First compile the script using the same checker. Can't edit → Return to diagnosis directly, no pop-up window, no disk placement. Let users approve
//      A piece of code that cannot be programmed will only interrupt the agent's own error correction and retry loop with a decision that has no effect.
//      (Same comment in create-workflow.ts).
//   2. Clean → Confirmation window. Writing a file into the user's repository is an irrevocable outward action, always ask.
//   3. Allow → Place the order.
//
// The key difference from CreateWorkflow is the question asked in the confirmation window: "Do you want to spend this money to run this code?"
// The question here is "Should I leave this code in the warehouse so that it may be run by others in the future?" Facts needed to answer it - landing point,
// Metadata, and **whether this time is new or overwritten** - are calculated into normalized input parameters by `resolveInput`, so this tool
// Deliberately **without any display**: the input channel is transparent transmission without schema for each client version, and the display
// The new fields cannot be read by the old client, and may even cause the entire payload to fail to be verified (see tool-result-metadata.ts
// field collection annotation). The new desktop reads the parameters according to toolName and renders the rich confirmation block. Whether to overwrite or not is distinguished by the `overwrite` field;
// Old desktop and legacy v3 get common permission prompt + complete input JSON - downgraded but complete content.
