// The identity segment of the dynamic workflow child.
//
// It replaces the interactive Agent Identity ("You are an interactive ZCode agent that helps
// users"): The readers of the subagent are scripts, not people. It **does** not replace other segments of the base - safe IMPORTANT lines with
// `# Harness` blocks are reused verbatim from identity, and memory/skills/item directives are appended as usual by builder.
// The persona written by the author is superimposed after the opening sentence and before the contract: the character is more forward and eye-catching than the general rules, but the opening sentence puts it first
// "Who do you belong to, and whom do you export it to?" Persona cannot overturn it.
//
// The contract was branched according to persona's instrument level; the GLM sub-agent with zero instrument in the real offer was
// "Ground every claim in something you read or ran" forces you to read directories and run commands, but it does not have these tools.
// So a degenerate `escalate("placeholder")` is emitted. The method of practice is to talk about the tool surface to death: the sub-agent first knows what he has,
// Then be told where the evidence comes from. After the tool stall exits,
// Each sub-agent has a complete set of working tools, and the contract returns to a text; the principle of "talking about the tools" remains unchanged.
